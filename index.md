## **Biography**
I am a DPhil (Ph.D.) student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), advised by [Irina Voiculescu](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/irina.voiculescu/) and [Peter Minary](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/peter.minary/).  Thanks to the generous support from [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) and ColoState, I obtained my Master of Science (MSc) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree from the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/ece/), [Colorado State University, USA](https://www.colostate.edu/), in 2019, 2017 respectively. 

In a broad sense, my interests lie in the fields of probabilistic machine learning and bioinformatics. I am particularly interested in applying deep learning techniques for generative models, uncertainty quantification and CRISPR-related research. Most of my work is trying to provide real-world solutions for interdisciplinary research.

## **Services**  

Serve as a volunteer group leader for the local hospital and Red Cross Society every summer since 2015. [***Newspaper Report***](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/biQ6I7wbfl4Pc99Zc8EvIw) 

In general, I'm responsible for leading a small group of volunteers in multiple hospital events such as fundraising for the Emergency Room, organizing blood donations, spending time at the hospital, and so on. At the same time, I'm also the leader for simultaneous interpretation (Mandarin/English) in Emergency Medical Response (EMR) training program.
